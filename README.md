# ft_get_next_line

### What is get_next_line? Why is this project important?
This project is about the function that return newline ('\n')
get_next_line is basically reads a file line by line.
There are easier methods of doing this by using standard C functions. But the goal here isto get better at C. Therefore ecole 42 allow that only three standard library functions: free, malloc, read.
So it makes the project harder. But you can also use functions from your libft project.

After finishing this project, you will have more clearly information about static variables, pointers, arrays,dynamic memory allocation and file descriptor(fd).
